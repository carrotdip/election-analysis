# Create two variables called name and country that will hold strings

# Create two variables called age and hourly_wage that will hold integers

#Create a variable called daily_wage that will hold the value of hourly_wage multiplied by 8

#Use a traditional string concatenation to print the name, country, age, and hourly_wage variables
